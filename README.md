# scRNAseq-Ibrutinib

scRNAseq data on 16 patients who received ibrutinib plus nivolumab on a phase 1 study here at Ohio State.  Ibrutinib is a small molecule inhibitor of Brutonâ€™s tyrosine kinase that we have shown inhibits immune suppressor cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells  and tumor associated macrophages) and significantly improves PD-1 blocking antibody therapy (A. Stiff CA Res 2016, B. Benner Oncoimmunology 2019).   We analyzed patient immune cells at baseline and after one week of ibrutinib.
